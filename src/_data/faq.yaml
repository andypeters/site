    a: Yes! Visit our <a href="/sponsorship" class="text-primary hover:text-dark">Sponsorship Page</a>.
  - q: Will the conference talks be recorded?
    a: >-
      This is a stretch goal. If we sell enough tickets to cover the cost of
      recording the talks, we will and the videos will be released online for
      free.
  - q: Wait. What are Stretch Goals?
    a: >-
      This is an excellent idea from the folks at Blue Ridge Ruby. The financial
      goal of the conference is simply to not lose money and we have no
      idea how many people we'll get. The plan is to make it work with a small
      number of attendees. Our stretch goals include recording the talks,
      t-shirts, and breakfast burritos.
  - q: What's the COVID policy?
    a: >-
      Based on current CDC guidelines, we will not have a mask or vaccine
      mandates. However, masks are welcome and vaccination encouraged (science
      works!). If you are feeling unwell, please do not attend, we will refund
      your ticket on request.
  - q: Will there be a job fair?
    a: "No, but we will have a #jobs channel on our conference Slack group for companies and attendees to share opportunities."

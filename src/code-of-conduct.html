  language and imagery are inappropriate for any conference venue, including
  talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
  expelled from the conference at the conference organizersâ€™ discretion.

  Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related
  to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
  size, race, or religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate
  intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording;
  sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact;
  and any unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing
  behavior are expected to comply immediately.

  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, conference organizers may take
  any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion
  from the conference. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is
  being harassed, or have any other concerns regarding violations of this
  policy, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
